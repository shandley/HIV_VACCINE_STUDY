# The human enteric bacteriome and virome do not regulate responses to nor change in response to an adenovirus serotype 26-based HIV-1 vaccine candidate

Data and code repository for our study examining the enteric bacterial and viral microbiome of samples collected for a Human HIV vaccine (adenovirus serotype 26) safety trial

# Highlights
- A longitudinal bacterial microbiome and virome study in a well-characterized human cohort across two continents
- Geography is the main factor influencing the bacterial and viral microbiome
- Ad26-based HIV-1 vaccines are well tolerated regardless of the vaccinee’s bacterial and viral microbiomes

**Summary:** The intestinal microbiota is an important factor that influences the development and regulation of host immune systems. However, the interplay between endogenous microbial populations and systemically administered vaccines has not been well explored. Here, we analyzed the fecal bacteriome and virome from 154 samples collected early and late in the vaccination time course from mosaic HIV-1-vaccinated healthy individuals in Uganda, Rwanda, and the US. Geography was the major driver of microbiota differences within our cohort. Our analysis indicates that Ad26-based HIV-1 vaccination does not affect the enteric bacteriome or virome regardless of the geographic location of those vaccinated and differential microbial communities within a given country are not associated with immune responses to vaccination. Thus, in addition to having a robust safety profile, the Ad26-based HIV-1 vaccine is also well-tolerated regardless of a vaccinee’s enteric microbial communities.
